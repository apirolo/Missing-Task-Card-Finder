# Missing-Task-Card-Finder
Simple tool to find missing task cards in a folder.

This was some code I threw together to automate a repetitive task I had to do for a job.

The main purpose is to search a folder on your filesystem for file names containing text matching that which you input into the function. 

I ended up wanting to refresh my memory of making simple graphical user interfaces (GUIs), so I adopted the function into a simple "application" 
with a GUI. 

This was my first real project using python outside of data analysis in quite some time so the code is, admittedly, pretty rough.
